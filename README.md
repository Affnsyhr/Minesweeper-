## 📚 Course Description

In this course, you will learn how to build scalable, performant, and well-tested React applications using **TypeScript**, **Redux Toolkit**, and modern frontend development tools. You’ll go beyond simple CRUD apps and focus on real-world architectural patterns and best practices adopted by professional developers.

## 🛠️ Key Topics Covered

### 1. ✅ React with TypeScript
- Type your React components, props, and state.
- Ensure compile-time safety and refactor with confidence.
- Use utility types and generics to build robust, reusable components.

### 2. 🧪 Testing React Applications
- Use **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to write:
  - Unit tests for components and hooks.
  - Integration tests for complex interactions.
  - Mock external dependencies and events.

### 3. 🧱 Storybook for UI Development
- Visualize components in isolation.
- Create component libraries with interactive controls and documentation.
- Facilitate better collaboration between developers and designers.

### 4. 🔁 TDD (Test-Driven Development) with React Hooks
- Write failing tests first, then make them pass.
- Focus on building logic via hooks before UI implementation.
- Structure hooks using `useReducer`, `useCallback`, and custom logic.

### 5. 🧩 State Management with Redux Toolkit
- Use `createSlice`, `createAsyncThunk`, and entity adapters.
- Integrate Redux with TypeScript for fully typed global state.
- Handle async operations and error states in a clean, maintainable way.
